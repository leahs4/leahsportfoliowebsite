            Hi! My name is Leah Sun and I am an upcoming Junior at UCI studying Computer Science and Psychology. I pride myself in being a hard worker, resilient, and most importantly,
            highly organized. I enjoy solving complex problems, whether that be in my code, or in the games I play ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ.
          </p>
          <p class="animate__animated animate__zoomIn">During my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, as well as playing games such as League of Legends & Stardew Valley. I would say I am a huge foodie, I love eating
          all sorts of bread, although I try to stay away from it. I also really enjoy traveling, hiking, and exploring new terrain.</p>
